# Standards directory community platform
A place for individuals and teams to collaborate and share information on standards, services and APIs that help build interoperable technology in health and social care to improve the [Standards directory](https://nhs-standards-registry.herokuapp.com/v5/home).
## Working in the open
The community platform lives on GitHub, an open forum where everyone can see and get involved. It's grouped into 3 areas:
- [standards community backlog](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/projects/1): 
identify gaps and suggest improvements to help make standards development more interoperable
- [local specification discussions](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/discussions/4): 
share local standards, or specifications, used across local services
- [use case discussions](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/discussions/5): 
find out how standards can be used to address common needs.
