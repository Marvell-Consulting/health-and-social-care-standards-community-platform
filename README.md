# Standards directory community platform
A place for individuals and teams to collaborate and share information on standards, services and APIs that help build interoperable technology in health and social care to improve the [Standards directory](https://nhs-standards-registry.herokuapp.com/v5/home).
## Working in the open
The community platform lives on GitHub, an open forum where everyone can see and get involved. It's grouped into 3 areas:
- [standards community backlog](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/projects/1): 
where gaps can be identified and improvements made to help make standards development more interoperable
- [local specification discussions](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/discussions/4): 
where local standards, or specifications, can be shared and used across services
- [use case discussions](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/discussions/5): 
where the community can find out what standards can be used and how to apply them to address common needs and develop greater interoperability.

Read our [contribution guidance](https://nhs-standards-registry.herokuapp.com/v5/community-contribution) to understand how to contribute. You can view the backlog and discussions but to actively contribute to these, you will need to create a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/)
