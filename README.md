# Health and social care standards community platform
This platform is open to everyone who uses, develops and assesses standards, services and APIs relating to interoperable technology in health and social care. 

## How this platform works
The platform is hosted on GitHub, an open source platform designed for collaboration. 

You will need a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you want to comment, start a discussion or make a contribution to the standards development backlog.

You do not need to create a Github account to browse and search.  

## What you can do on the platform

The platform has two main areas. In the:

- [standards development backlog](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/projects/1), 
you can read proposed additions or changes to existing standards, raise your own issue using a template and comment on others’ proposals

- [discussions forum](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/discussions),
you can read discussions on local specifications, use cases and standards implementation, post a new discussion and respond to others’ posts


Both the standards development backlog and the discussions forum are moderated by the [Standards Directory](#) team. 
You can find more information about how to contribute on the [contribution guidance page in the Standards Directory (opens in new window)](https://nhs-standards-registry.herokuapp.com/v5/community-contribution).
